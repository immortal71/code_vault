You are improving the UI/UX of an existing Code Snippet Manager web application. The app is built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. Here are the specific improvements needed:

   - On click: navigate to relevant pages (Total Snippets → /snippets, Collections → /collections, etc.)
   - Add visual feedback on click with scale animation (0.98 for 100ms)
   - Replace percentage text with actual trend icons (use Lucide React TrendingUp/TrendingDown icons)
   - Icons should be green for positive trends, red for negative

2. **Enhance Language Distribution Pie Chart**
   - Make each pie segment clickable to filter snippets by that language
   - Add hover effects: highlight segment, show enhanced tooltip with exact count and percentage

    - Snippet cards should be single column on mobile
    - Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44x44px)

## DESIGN SYSTEM CONSISTENCY

- Use consistent spacing (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px)
- Maintain color consistency with existing theme
- Use existing shadcn/ui components where possible
- Keep dark mode as primary theme
- Ensure light mode also looks polished

IMPORTANT: Do not change the core functionality or data structure. Only improve the UI/UX, animations, interactivity, and visual polish. Maintain all existing features while making them more delightful to use.
